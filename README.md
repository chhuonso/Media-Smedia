This project was base off my curiosity of image upload. I realized that creating a form to upload anything with images usually is that image is to large to uplaod or store. To do so I found Cloudinary Api to help with that. I wanted to store some of my images from my local hardrive for temporary use so that I can have them display. I've also noticed using cloudinary api they limit of 10 images per loading. The next thing was to load up the next 10 images with the previous loaded images by creating a button to do so.
